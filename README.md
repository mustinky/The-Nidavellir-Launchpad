This repository contains a **game cheat loader** developed using **C++**. The loader fetches a DLL file and injects it into a running game process. Once injected, the loader allows manipulation of various game parameters, exploits, and triggers custom behaviors such as sending packets and causing crashes.

## What is this loader?

The loader is a **C++-based** application that dynamically loads and injects a DLL into a running game process. Once injected, the DLL can interact with the game's memory and network protocols to perform exploits, send custom packets, and trigger specific in-game behaviors.

### Key Points

- **DLL Injection**: The loader fetches the DLL and injects it into the game process.
- **Dynamic Interaction**: Once injected, the loader interacts with the game’s memory and network to manipulate in-game data and behavior.
- **C++ Design**: Written in C++ for performance and control over the game’s memory and network operations.
